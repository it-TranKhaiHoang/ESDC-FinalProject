# ESDC Final Project

This project is a Task Management Module, only ensuring some basic functions just enough
for the team leader to manage the work and project participants as well as support communication
between members and team leaders about the tasks. The project was implemented and developed
under the guidance of university faculty.

## Installation
To install packages to and from the public npm registry or a private npm registry, you must install Node.js and the npm command line interface using either a Node version manager or a Node installer. We strongly recommend using a Node version manager like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install Node.js and npm. We do not recommend using a Node installer, since the Node installation process installs npm in a directory with local permissions and can cause permissions errors when you run npm packages globally.
To download the latest version of npm, on the command line, run the following command:
```bash
npm install -g npm
```
Checking your version of npm and Node.js:
```bash
node -v
npm -v
```
Installing all the dependencies of project
```bash
npm install
```
## Usage
Start server
```bash
npm start
```
